//Array,string ,function are also objects in javascript

//important//
// Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype.
// The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain.
// The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
//  When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, then the prototype's prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached, in which case undefined is returned.

// So when we call myObject.toString(), the browser:

// looks for toString in myObject
// can't find it there, so looks in the prototype object of myObject for toString
// finds it there, and calls it.
// What is the prototype for myObject? To find out, we can use the function Object.getPrototypeOf():
// Object.getPrototypeOf(myObject); // Object { }


//lets do some example
// let myname = "rahul   "
// myname.prototype.correctname = function(){
//     console.log(this.trim().length);      //length is a property so no paranthesis  while trim is a method so we are using parenthesis.
// }
// myname.correctname();

//this will thrown an error 
// The error is because you are trying to use .prototype on a string literal variable,
// but primitive values (like strings, numbers, booleans) donâ€™t have a prototype property you can directly modify.
// prototype is only for constructor functions or classes (like String, Array, Function), not for already-created primitive values.

String.prototype.correctname = function(){
    console.log(this.trim().length);      //length is a property so no paranthesis  while trim is a method so we are using parenthesis.
};
