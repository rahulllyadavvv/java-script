//Data types
//primitive data tyoes in java
//1.number 2.string 3.null 4. undefined 5.symbol 6.boolean 7.Bigint 


//reference type datatype (non premetive)
//arrays,object,function


// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
// This means that:
// Type checking occurs at runtime:
// The type of a variable is determined when the code is executed, not during a compilation phase.
// Variable types can change:
// A single variable can hold values of different data types throughout the program's execution. You do not explicitly declare the type of a variable when you define it.
// For example:
// JavaScript

// let myVariable = 10; // myVariable is a number
// console.log(typeof myVariable); // "number"

// myVariable = "Hello World"; // myVariable is now a string
// console.log(typeof myVariable); // "string"

//let useremail;  (if the variable is declared like this is by default undefined)
// let useremail = undefined 
// const score =100
// const finalscore =100.56
// const isLoggedIn = false
// const isoutside = null

//Genrally to define  a uniquee id we use symbol 
//const id = symbol('123')
//const anotherid = symbol('123') 
//now here we can see we have given the same string in the both symbol so we expect to get same value as output but 
//no it doesnt work that whay we will get the unique values 





//arrays are in square brackets
//const heroes =["shaktiman","doga","captainamerica"]



//objects are defined in curly brackets
// let myobj ={
//     name:"rahul",
//     age:20,
// }

//a fucntion has both paranthesis and curly brackets
//function(){}  (stroing ina variable)

//const my func = function(){
//     console.log("Hello World")

// }
//genrally if you would check the data type of non premitive (reference type  ) using typeof 
//you wil find out the dta type of array,object is function
//and the data type of function in object function
